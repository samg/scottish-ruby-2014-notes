There's a book called Nonviolent communication that he really likes.

Nonviolent communication by Marshall Rosenberg

VIOLENCE
* Often associated with physical acts
* other kinds of violence (dismissive comments, judgements)

"TDD doesn't work for me", "You're an idiot"

MORALISTIC JUDGEMENTS
* somebody does something and you judge them

Action -> judgement -> action -> judgement

Judgement blocks empathy.  Once you label someone in a box you don't empathize.

Observe without evaluation.

"You are too generous"  100% evaluation

"When I see you giving all your lunch money to others, I think you are being
too generous." factual observation, and takes responsibility for evaluation.

"John was angry with me for now reason."

vs.

"John pounded his fist on the table and raised his voice.  I didn't understand
why." (better.  starts with objective observation.  takes responsibility for the judgement)

OBSERVATION + EVALUATION = CRITICISM = RESISTANCE

```
Action => Observation -> Feeling -> Judgement (only concious of the judgement)

                      ^
                      |
                    Needs
```

Feelings arise from un-met needs.  You start to notice when you're judging
other people and can then understand how what the feeling is behind the
judgement and the need behind that feeling.

FEELINGS:

* Describing feelings makes us vulnerable.
* It isn't very British
* Most of us have a better vocabulary for insulting and judging others than for
  describing feelings.

COMMON MISTAKES

* "I feel like you ignore my opinions" (doesn't describe feelings.  could say "I
  think")


Negative message from other leads to several possibilities
1. Blame yourself
2. Blame others/Lash out ("You make me so angry")
3. Sense your own feelings & needs (this is the good one)

Others stimulate feelings in you, but they're not the cause of your feelings.

MAKING REQUESTS

* Talk about what you want someone to do instead of what they should stop
  doing. (positive language)
* Make requests concrete and clear.
* Request (you can say no) vs. demand (you can't)
* Can reveal unrealistic needs

Stages of making requests:

1. Blame yourself or others == Emotional Slavery
2. Understand own feelings/need == Obnoxious
3. Balancing your own needs with others == Emotional Liberation

When someone brings you a problem, before trying to solve it first empathize.
Avoid giving advice or reassurance. Instead help them to discover their
feelings/needs.  Ask them questions to understand what they're feeling and why
they're feeling it. Active listening (feed back to the person what you think they've just said to confirm your understanding.)


TAKEAWAYS

1. Judgement is where violence starts.  We all do it, but should be aware of the problems it causes.
2. The root of judgements are feelings and the root of feelings are needs.
3. observations, feelings, needs, requests
4. Only one person in the conversation needs to understand this for it to work.

Look up Linda Risen's talks as well. "How not to talk to your kids."
