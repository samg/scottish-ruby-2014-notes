UXing without a UXer

Users vs Product vs UX vs UI

```
User == Person
Product == Bike
UI == Seat, Pedals, Handlebars
UX == Wind in your hair, etc.
```

The elephant in the room:

"I want to build great things... I start out with good intentions but it always
turns out rubbish... what happened?"


If you're at A and trying to get to B, don't take the direct path.  Your
journey will be a squiggly line if it includes great UI, etc.


### How important is it to have one vision?

Vision on the wall.

What **one thing** do you want it to **do well**?  Don't do 10 things kind of
okay.

A story - She had to decide what the product should be.  She interviewed 12
stakeholders and got 12 visions.  Having a vision is important.  Sharing it is
even more important.  Put it on the wall.

It's simple until you make it complicated.  Build for the 90%.  Don't build
features for 1% of your customers.  Then 99% are seeing something not essential
to them.

### How to think like a user.

* What are they doing?
* Why are they at your place?
* What are they trying to achieve?

* Who are they?
* Really think and write out who will use your app/website.
* Write out their age, education, job, etc.
* Name them.  This makes it real.  You reference them in product discussions.

Fight for your user.  Users are the most important stakeholder (not the owner
of the company).

e.g. "I just want to buy what I want and get out"

### Why you should wireframe and how to do it.

Having one idea is great.  Iterating on an idea is better.  Trying multiple
ideas gives you the best solution.

Use paper, but Balsamiq is good wireframing software.

also

InvisionApp

Axure - less fast but High Fidelity

### How to make a throwaway prototype.

Paper prototyping.

### How to evaluate your work.

Put on the shoes of your user.  Pretend to be your user, since you know who they are.

Also,

Usability Hub - you do tests for other people to get karma and they do yours.
You can also pay for credits.

Or

Stick it up on the wall.  "Sketchboarding"

...

Why are you doing all this?

Greatness doesn't take shortcuts.

...

What if I can't evaluate it fairly?

Find a friend.  Don't say anything.  Don't direct them since they want to
please you and will want to click where you want them to.

### When to scrap it and start again.

Keep it or bin it? - This is the important question.

Can I build a business on this? etc.

Don't get attached.  You want to try to see it for what it is.  Sometimes you
do need to scrap it.
