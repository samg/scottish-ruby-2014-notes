* iRobot (w/ will smith) - definitely watch this
* my responses are limited, you must ask the right questions

Book recomendation:

* self documenting
* easy to monitor transitions

Micromachine gem is simple state machine gem (48 lines of code)


SM is good for 

* concurrent, asyncrounous processes
* multiple interdependent booleans

Circuit breaker pattern:
* useful for external api
* Closed -> Open -> Half Open -> Closed
